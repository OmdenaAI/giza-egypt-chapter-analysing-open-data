Twelve others were wounded in the crash.It was later revealed that the victims were among a group of doctors who received a surprise notice demanding them to travel to Cairo the following morning to attend a compulsory training as part of a governmental women's health initiative programme, or else face punitive measures.""The EMS is the highest authority for doctors. It is empowered to take all necessary measures to put an end to the administrative abuse that makes doctors prone to such unfortunate events, protect them during the course of their work and defend their dignity,"" the syndicate said in a statement on Thursday.Screenshots showing a conversation on WhatsApp, purportedly between the victims and their superiors, circulating online showed that the doctors were warned that no apologies will be accepted and that ""those who do not want to participate in the programme will be reassigned outside the health administration.""Doctors had to arrange for a microbus to take them to Cairo on daybreak as it was not possible for them to find a train reservation or another proper method to travel at such short-notice. Microbus drivers in Egypt are notorious for their reckless driving and ignoring traffic regulations.One of the wounded doctors was pregnant and lost her foetus and had to undergo a hysterectomy.EMS head Hussein Khairy called for questioning Minister of Health Hala Zayed over the accident before parliament, criticising administrative arbitrariness in dealing with doctors.The syndicate's youth committee pledged it will not forego the rights of the victims and said the accident was the result of the Health Ministry's ""intransigence and oppression.""The class to which the newly graduated doctors belonged called for a general strike at all health units nationwide to protest against the deaths.A matter of 'fate'Speaking to reporters in Luxor days after the accident, Zayed said the accident was a matter of fate, adding that road accidents are outside the jurisdiction of her ministry.The minister defended the travel decision saying that everywhere around the world there are high-tech training centres where people are required to travel to gain experience.She dismissed criticism that her ministry has failed to provide the victims with a safe travel means, claiming that all means of transportation in the country are safe and overseen by the government.The ministry's decision to compensate the wounded and families of the dead sparked further criticism.Social media users opened fire at the ministry's announcement to send the parents of the deceased doctors to the annual Muslim pilgrimage, as one of the late doctors was a Christian.Earlier this week, the syndicate ordered the questioning of five health ministry officials including a minister adviser over the accident.The medical union filed a complaint earlier this week with the country's prosecutor-general demanding an investigation into the accident. It also demanded that prosecutors open an administrative probe.The union said it would pay financial compensation between 10,000 and 100,000 ($633-$6,334) to the victims.Search Keywords: Egypt  Minya Accident  Ministry of Health  Hala Zayed  Egyptian Medical Syndicate  road accidents Short link:  "

If the new draft becomes law, it will be the biggest reform of the country's traffic regulations since the 1973 law was passed.The draft legislation includes a new electronic system for licensing and ticketing aimed at reducing road accidents in Egypt.According to recent data released by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), a total of 5,343 people were killed and 18,646 others injured as a result of traffic accidents in 2016, while 21,089 vehicles were destroyed.The number of road accidents in 2016 was 14,710, an increase of 1.1 percent compared with the figure of 14,548 for 2015. Meanwhile, 9.4 million vehicles were licensed in Egypt in 2016.The draft law also proposes an electronic ticketing system for traffic violations and a penalty-point system that would see repeat offenders lose their licences. At present, minor traffic violations are generally punished through fines only.The draft law also prohibits vehicles manufactured more than five years before from obtaining public transport licences. Vehicles that already hold licences and are under 20 years old may continue to renew their licences, while those over 20 will not be able to do so.The law also criminalizes the erection of unauthorized speed bumps. Search Keywords:Egypt  Traffic law  Road  Accidents Short link:  "

Private vehicles cause 33 percent of accidents, followed by microbuses (9 percent) and buses (7 percent).The report further stressed that speeding was responsible for most accidents.""It is not a big secret that many of those drivers drive under influence of narcotics because they believe that drugs will make them more active and awake, as driving trucks for long distances needs a lot of effort,"" Mahdy said.From his point of view, other human factors also contribute to an increase in the rate of car accidents – education level, illiteracy and knowledge of traffic laws.""Many drivers in Egypt ignore traffic laws and signs, not to mention that some of them can't read or write, like many truck drivers, for instance,"" he said.""If we want to reduce the rate of accidents, then we have to start changing the culture of the citizen when it comes to traffic.""The condition of a vehicle is another important element to consider.""Recently we found out that many drivers are using cars with cheap types as well as brakes, not to mention that there are old cars and vehicles on the road that shouldn't be there in the first place,"" he said.Bad roads, more deathsDespite road conditions only contributing to around 2 percent of accidents in Egypt, poor maintenance and the substandard quality of the country's highways is still responsible for the rate of accidents going up.Half of the road networks in Egypt qualify as poor and suffer from a lack of maintenance, according to the road research centre within the ministry of interior's traffic department.Speaking at a conference on international road safety in Cairo last March, Transportation Minister Ibrahim El-Demery said that Egypt's fatal traffic chaos can only be solved by building an entirely new road and highway network system.It's not just speed and poor highways that causes deaths, though. Bad weather is also to blame at times. In early March, the Sohag-Red Sea highway was closed after a landslide following bad weather conditions and heavy rain.An official in the traffic accident department at the General Authority for Roads and Highways told Ahram Online that a highway's level of safety is gauged after a final report is issued in order to determine if the number of deaths is being caused by the highway itself or human error.Half of Egypt’s road and highway networks are operated and maintained by the General Authority for Roads and Bridges, under the transportation ministry. According to an official in the authority, the other half of the network is maintained by the army or by governorates, municipalities or local councils.The official told Ahram Online that only last February the authority began to start a new system for periodic maintenance on roads and highways. The system is currently in its earliest test phase, with experts and engineers undergoing training.Mahdy, the traffic professor, says that there is a hierarchical system of quality when it comes to roads and highways in Egypt. At the top are those constructed by the General Authority. Then comes the roads built by governorates, followed by those from municipalities.Roads between villages and towns and between governorates are lower in quality than main highways like the Cairo-Alexandria desert road, Mahdy added.Still, the Cairo-Alexandria desert road has had more accidents than any other in the country, according to the government's traffic accident department.The highway is currently being operated and maintained by the army, which will continue to do so for the next 50 years.Another road with a high rate of accidents is the Cairo-Alexandria agricultural road, which passes through the Nile Delta.Many avoid it for fear of accidents, often caused by the high number of heavy trucks transporting goods between governorates, as well as speeding, of course, and the occasional instance of fog. Search Keywords: Roads  Accidents  Short link:  "
